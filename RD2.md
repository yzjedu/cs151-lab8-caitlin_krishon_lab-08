I was supposed to learn how to manipulate functions, loops, and lists to design a program that counts the sum of dice.


We began by thinking of ways to solve the various steps in the problem. After, we begin working on possible ways to design our code.
Next, we defined the tasks that needed functions.Lastly, we wrote the code using various functions and loops.


Initially, we experienced some issues with manipulating the list index to hold values of 2 at position 0.
After this issue was resolved the results matched what we expected. We used various test cases ensuring our values held.

We encountered challenges converting our initial code to a code utilizing functions for high level tasks and understanding
all the ways to manipulate a list. We overcame them by trying concepts we knew worked with other variables.
I learned a better grasp of how to work with functions and lists. I learned what I was supposed to learn for this lab.
I enjoyed working with my partner.
